# Service Discovery Pattern with Go

Service discovery is a crucial aspect of microservices architecture, allowing services to find and communicate with each other dynamically. Below is an example of implementing a simple service discovery pattern using Go (Golang). We will use a centralized service registry approach where a service registry (e.g., a simple HTTP server) keeps track of available services.

##Â Components
- Service Registry: A centralized registry where services register themselves and clients query to discover available services.
- Service: A microservice that registers itself with the service registry.
- Client: A client that queries the service registry to find available services.

### Service Registry

The registry will have endpoints to register a service and to list available services.

### Service

The `service` will register itself to the `registry` service.
